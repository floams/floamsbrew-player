# floamsbrew-player
## simple little html/js webplayer (like spotify)

* currently only local files

## this is a simple little project ive made because i was bored and wanted to do things with music and html lol, this uses multiple libraries and apis to work, so if they dont work blame them, not me.
#### (album covers dont always get found, so add them yourself by clicking the cover)
